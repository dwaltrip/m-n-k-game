m-n-k-game
==========

Source code for a simple Pygame based implementation of the generalized version of tic-tac-toce ([m-n-k game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game)) that I wrote for fun a few years ago.

The game is played on your local computer, with your opponent sitting next to you. To start the game, run the python script from your terminal

    python tictactoe.py

Dependencies
------------
* Python 2.7 (may work with other versions)
* Pygame ([website](http://pygame.org/download.shtml))
